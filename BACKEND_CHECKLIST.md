# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for your application, ensuring seamless integration with your React/Next.js frontend and supporting all required features. The stack includes Rust (Solana SDK) for blockchain, TypeScript for APIs and logic, Supabase for auth/data, and Vercel for deployment.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Monorepo/Directory Structure**: Organize backend (Rust, TypeScript) and frontend (Next.js) codebases clearly.
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Centralize and document all required env vars (API keys, DB URLs, secrets, etc.).
- [ ] **.env Management**: Use `.env.local` for local dev, `.env.production` for prod. Never commit secrets.
- [ ] **GitHub Repo**: Ensure all code is versioned, with protected branches and CI/CD workflows.

## 2. API & Server Logic (TypeScript/Node.js)
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Implement REST/GraphQL endpoints for all frontend needs (node status, metrics, logs, user actions, etc.).
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Use Zod or similar for validating all incoming data.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses and logging.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Security**: Protect endpoints with rate limiting, CORS, and authentication.
- [ ] **Testing**: Write unit/integration tests for all endpoints (Jest/Testing Library).

## 3. Blockchain Integration (Rust, Solana SDK)
- [ ] **Rust Service**: Set up a Rust microservice using Solana SDK for blockchain operations (transactions, wallet mgmt, etc.).
- [ ] **API Bridge**: Expose Rust logic via HTTP/gRPC endpoints callable from the TypeScript API layer.
- [ ] **Wallet Management**: Securely handle wallet creation, signing, and storage (never expose private keys to frontend).
- [ ] **Transaction Logic**: Implement and test all required Solana transaction flows.
- [ ] **Unit & Integration Tests**: Use Rust testing tools for blockchain logic.

## 4. Database & Auth (Supabase)
- [ ] **Schema Design**: Model users, nodes, logs, metrics, strategies, etc. in Supabase/Postgres.
- [ ] **Auth Integration**: Use Supabase Auth for user sign-up, login, and session management.
- [ ] **Row-Level Security**: Enforce RLS policies for user data isolation.
- [ ] **Realtime/Subscriptions**: Enable Supabase realtime for live updates (logs, metrics, status).
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Validate and sanitize all data before writing to DB.

## 5. Frontend Integration
- [ ] **API Consumption**: Connect all frontend components to backend endpoints (node status, metrics, logs, controls, etc.).
- [ ] **WebSockets/Realtime**: Use Supabase or custom sockets for live updates (logs, node status, metrics).
- [ ] **Error & Loading States**: Handle all API states in the UI.
- [ ] **Auth Flows**: Ensure protected routes and user session management.

## 6. Production Readiness
- [ ] **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, building, and deploying both backend and frontend.
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment**: Configure Vercel for Next.js frontend and serverless API routes. Deploy Rust microservice (if needed) as a separate service (e.g., Fly.io, Railway, or Vercel Edge Functions if compatible).
- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrate error tracking (Sentry), performance monitoring, and centralized logging.
- [ ] **Backups**: Automate DB backups (Supabase/Postgres).
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: Use Vercel/Supabase secrets for all sensitive data.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document all endpoints, data models, and integration points (README, OpenAPI, etc.).

## 7. Post-Deployment
- [ ] **Smoke Testing**: Verify all critical paths after deployment.
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Load test APIs and blockchain logic.
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Review for common vulnerabilities (OWASP, blockchain-specific).
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Set up channels for bug reports and feature requests.

## Component/Feature Mapping
- **Node Dashboard**: Backend must provide node status, metrics, logs, and control endpoints.
- **Network Picker**: Serve available networks and handle switching logic.
- **Node Console**: Support command execution, history, and suggestions via API.
- **Node Controls**: Expose start/stop/pause/reset endpoints.
- **Node Metrics/Status Bar**: Provide real-time metrics and status updates.
- **Landing/Animated Sections**: No backend, but ensure all dynamic data is API-driven if needed.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React TS, Next.js
- **Backend**: TypeScript (API), Rust (Solana SDK)
- **Database/Auth**: Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend & serverless), external for Rust if needed
